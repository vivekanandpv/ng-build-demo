To create multiple environments such as staging, preprod, etc, 
please check the environment folder

Replacement of these environment is defined in angular.json under
configuration of build and serve sections. Also, note that the configuration
of staging, preprod, etc refers to the browserTarget of build configuration

To serve the application (in development machine) under different serve
configurations, use ng s --configuration=staging

To build the application under different configuration, use
ng b --configuration=preprod        # production is default for ng b
